# MovieSearch
### Movie search app

MovieSearch is a React app that pulls data from [themoviedb.org](themoviedb.org). You can search movies by the title of the movie. A card will appear with an option to show more details. In the expanded card view, users are allowed to cast votes for a movie. [Demo video can be viewed here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0uABgPU4XY).
